// There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.
// Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
// Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
// Example 1:
// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
//              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
// Example 2:
// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: false
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
//              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
//              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
// Constraints:
// The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
// You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
// 1 <= numCourses <= 10^5
//    Hide Hint #1
// This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
//    Hide Hint #2
// Topological Sort via DFS - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.
//    Hide Hint #3
// Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
