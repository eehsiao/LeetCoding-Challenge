### Day1 : Arranging Coins

###  [Arranging Coins](https://github.com/eehsiao/LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/July2020/day1-arrangingCoins.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/July2020/day1-arrangingCoins_test.go)
```
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
Example 1:
n = 5
The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤
Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:
n = 8
The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤
Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```


### Day2 : Arranging Coins

###  [Arranging Coins](https://github.com/eehsiao/LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/July2020/day2-binaryTreeLevelOrderTraversalII.go)
```
Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
```
